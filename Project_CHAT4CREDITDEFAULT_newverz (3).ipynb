        "     - Axis labels (e.g., xaxis_title='Feature Name', yaxis_title='Value' for Plotly; plt.xlabel() for Matplotlib).\n",
        "     - Appropriate color scales or styles (e.g., 'Blues' for heatmap, distinct colors for box plots).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Output the plots as .png files:\n",
        "   - Save Plotly figures using fig.write_image('filename.png').\n",
